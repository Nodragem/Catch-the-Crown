If the platform's friction coefficient is one, the player should not be able to have a relative velocity to it's velocity. So just set 1f as the friction field of the moving platform FixtureDef.

If this doesn't work, make sure you didn't pass 0 as the density when creating the player fixture def, because kinematic friction is calculated as: friction=(friction coefficient)*(normal force) then a body without mass (density = 0), in most of the cases (Your is included in "most"), will have no friction.
