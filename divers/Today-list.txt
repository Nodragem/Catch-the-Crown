Today TODO-list:

[x] Tournamenent Mode,
[x] Diamond and Rubby addition,
[x] different coins distribution which can be activated by a triggerable,
[x] aiming arrow change: always displayed when aiming + charge more visible,
[x] switcher assets have been integrated,
[x] display backgroung on the background,
[x] switcher lance, make switchers for lances working (bug)
[x] debug: lance angle when connect/weldJoint on a rotated/rotating object was wrong,
[x] debug: fireball are doing weird thing when colliding an other fireball, (it seems that body.setActive(False) call endContact() of the contact listener, and then remove the fixture of the contactdata of the other fireball)
[x] improve Fixture ContactData --> reference to their fixture and deepFlush (clean Flush)

[/] bug: sometimes the player revive with automatic damage per second. In an attempt to debug, we replace flush() with the deepFlush() function in the isDead() function. We can't test if it is effective.

- bug: moving platform are pickable by the player!!
- bug: revive in the arm of a player if picked up...

Note: that the crown doesnt use the mainBoxContact, I dont know why

[x] add texture for platform, |--o--|
- Gold distribution: you see the money going from the place it's picked up to the chest of the player,
- spiking moving platform --> parent system, switch will also be able to follow a platform.
- Menu - restart/resume/quit/preference
